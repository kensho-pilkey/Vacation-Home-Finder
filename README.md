# **Vacation Home Finder**

This is a simple web application designed to help users find vacation homes based on their preferences. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project features a responsive design that works across all devices. Users can search for vacation homes by entering a location or selecting from a list of popular destinations and refine their search results with filters such as price range, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The application also integrates with the Google Maps API to provide an interactive map for exploring home locations.
